### 1. Debugging Dialog Display Issues
- **Objective**: Fix the issue where the dialog is not showing up when entering a new PIN.
- **Steps Taken**:
  - Added a console log before setting `showDialog` to `true` in the `checkExistingSession` function to verify the state change.
  - Modified the `checkExistingSession` function to handle multiple rows returned by the Supabase query.
  - Ensured that `setExistingSessionData` includes the manufacturer name in the `form_data` when setting the existing session data.

### 2. Display Manufacturer Name in Dialog
- **Objective**: Ensure the dialog displays the manufacturer's name along with the PIN.
- **Steps Taken**:
  - Updated the `setExistingSessionData` function to ensure the manufacturer's name is included in the `form_data`.
  - Modified the `DialogDescription` to display the manufacturer's name in bold.

## Instructions

- **Verify Dialog Functionality**: Test the application by entering a different PIN and hitting "Next" to ensure the dialog displays correctly with the manufacturer name.
- **Check Console Logs**: Ensure the console logs are appearing as expected to verify the execution path.
- **Review CSS and Visibility**: Check for any CSS or visibility issues that might affect the dialog display.
